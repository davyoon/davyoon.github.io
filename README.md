While making this game, I used some Javascript, Jquery, HTML and CSS.  I didn't know how to use animation so I just ended up using animate.css.  Also searched on Google to see how to play music.  


The MVP for this project was to make the boxes clickable, alternating between X and O, and to determine whether a player won or not.  There are just a few different features I added besides that which we learned in class.
